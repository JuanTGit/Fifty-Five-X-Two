# Fifty Five X Two Game

The "Fifty Five X Two" game is a simple betting game in which the player wagers a certain amount of in-game currency (gp) and rolls a virtual die. If the number rolled is greater than 55, the player wins the wagered amount. If the number rolled is less than or equal to 55, the player loses the wagered amount.
